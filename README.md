About Me

                                       Background & Journey

I come from a background in Finance , a field far removed from technology. Taking the leap into tech was a bold choice—a leap of faith to explore what the world of cloud computing could offer me. This journey hasn’t been easy. Rewiring my thinking to approach problems like a tech professional, learning through self-study, and navigating unfamiliar concepts tested my patience and perseverance.

But when your heart is in it, every challenge becomes an opportunity. No matter how slow or fast the progress, every milestone—whether the first, second, or third—is a victory. Today, as a freshly trained AWS re/Start student, I am energized and ready to build a new career path in cloud computing. This site is a window into my journey, showcasing my challenges, achievements, and the successes yet to come.

I am a tech enthusiast with a growing passion for cloud computing. What excites me most is how cloud technologies are transforming the way businesses operate, offering scalability, flexibility, and security like never before. I am fascinated by the potential to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions that make a tangible impact.

This passion drives my continuous learning and motivates me to grow within the tech industry, exploring new opportunities, mastering cloud technologies, and contributing to projects that harness the power of the cloud to help businesses thrive in the digital age.
